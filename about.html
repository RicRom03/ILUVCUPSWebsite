    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>I LUV CUPS</strong>! We’re a small, family-owned business with a passion for creativity, craftsmanship, and most importantly, faith. As a <em>mom and pop</em> operation, we pour our hearts into every custom cup we design, ensuring that each piece reflects our values, love for our craft, and dedication to making our customers’ visions come to life.</p>

Whether it’s a special gift for a loved one, a personalized addition to your home, or a unique promotional item for your business, we’re here to make your ideas a reality. For us, a cup is more than just a vessel — it’s a way to express personality, faith, and the meaningful moments that make life beautiful.</p>
    
    <p>Our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea: to offer high-quality, custom-designed cups that reflect the unique stories and beliefs of our customers. As a family, we’ve been blessed to do what we love, and every cup we create is crafted with care and a commitment to excellence.</p>
    
    <p>At <strong>I LUV CUPS</strong>, our faith is the foundation of everything we do. We believe that God has blessed our hands with the ability to create, and we strive to honor Him in all aspects of our business. Each order we receive is treated as a gift, and we approach every project with love, care, and gratitude. Our goal is to serve you with the same kindness and commitment we show to our own family.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for choosing <strong>I LUV CUPS</strong> for your custom cup needs. We’re incredibly thankful for the opportunity to share a bit of our family’s love and faith through our designs. We look forward to creating something special just for you — because at <strong>I LUV CUPS</strong>, it’s more than just a cup, it’s a reflection of who you are.</p>
